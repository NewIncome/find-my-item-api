## Getting Started

This APP uses PostgreSQL, so make sure you have it installed in your development and test environment. This could be changed in the `./config/database.yml` file if needed.

Also note that the database expects to have a specific user with a password (in `database.yml` file).

Feel free to create more entries in the `db/seeds.rd` file to generate more initial content.

To get started with the APP, clone [the repo :blue_book:](https://github.com/NewIncome/find-my-item-api) and then install the needed gems with:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, to seed moc data to the DB for interaction:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```


## Usage

For _example_, using [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) you can (after runnign the API in your local server):

// The user and/or item to be worked with will go in the link with it's ID.

```
$ http POST :3000/users name="New User Name"
```

```
$ http PUT :3000/items/1 description="New item #1 description"
```
- Delete an Item
```
$ http DELETE :3000/items/1
```
- See a User's Favorite List of Items
```
$ http :3000/users/3/favorites_lists
```
- Add an Item to a User's Favorite List
```
$ http POST :3000/users/3/favorites_lists item_id=1
```
